# WARNING: Do not deploy this tutorial configuration directly to a production environment
#
# The tutorial docker-compose files have not been written for production deployment and will not
# scale. A proper architecture has been sacrificed to keep the narrative focused on the learning
# goals, they are just used to deploy everything onto a single Docker machine. All FIWARE components
# are running at full debug and extra ports have been exposed to allow for direct calls to services.
# They also contain various obvious security flaws - passwords in plain text, no load balancing,
# no use of HTTPS and so on.
#
# This is all to avoid the need of multiple machines, generating certificates, encrypting secrets
# and so on, purely so that a single docker-compose file can be read as an example to build on,
# not use directly.
#
# When deploying to a production environment, please refer to the Helm Repository
# for FIWARE Components in order to scale up to a proper architecture:
#
# see: https://github.com/FIWARE/helm-charts/
